## A repository that covers the project 1 which is to mainly plan for the upcoming tasks
## Address on creation of repository for project
As far as it stands,i have decided that i will be creating new repository for each project that i will be working on this semester and they will be managed separately.

## Diagram for repo and project integration
Since the repositories are going to be linked to Kanban project so the diagram to show the integration is as follows...

## Branching strategy
As far as the branching strategy is concerned,i will be  using the Git Flow strategy where i believe that i will be using "main" and "develop" as the primary branches and will add other branches if neeeded(Feature,Release and Hotfix). There will be merging and pull request as i go to maintain the flow of all the projects.
## Use of .gitignore file
I believe there is going to be a lot of information that is going to be added on my profile so i will be adding a .gitignore file to all the projects to manage the access github have.
## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
I am planning to add the sensitive information and credentials on a .gitignore file so that it is not easily accessible

# Project2-API Development
- [Link to Project2 Repository](github.com/NOKOMATLWA/CMPG323-Project2-32681879.git)
## Project Description
-As part of this project, i will be creating a CRUD (CREATE, READ,UPDATE and DELETE) RESTful API that will connect to a provided database storing the IoT device data. The API should contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per resource â€“ aligning to the project's requirements. The RESTful API architecture has several endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database.  
- As it was stated in the README file of the project,i am going to be developing an API which i will be using different factors into making sure that it is fully deployed. For me to kickstart the whole project,i had to familiarize myself with the programs that were to be used and that includes getting access to Azure and installing Visual Studio,installing the Microsoft Entity Framework packages and the utilization of Swagger.
- I created the Azure resource group to store all the services that i will be using under the portal (that being the server for my database and the database itself)
