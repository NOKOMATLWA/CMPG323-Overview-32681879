## Diagram for repo and project integration
## Branching strategy
## Use of .gitignore file
I believe there is going to be a lot of information that is going to be added on my profile so i will be adding a .gitignore file to the projects that may need it   
## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
I am planning to add the sensitive information and credentials on a .gitignore file so that it is not easily accessible
