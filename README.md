## Diagram for repo and project integration
Since the repositories are going to be linked to Kanban project so the diagram to show the integration is as follows...

## Branching strategy
As far as the branching strategy is concerned,i will be  using the Git Flow strategy where i believe that i will be using "main" and "develop" as the primary branches and will add other branches if neeeded(Feature,Release and Hotfix). There will be merging and pull request as i go to maintain the flow of all the projects.
## Use of .gitignore file
I believe there is going to be a lot of information that is going to be added on my profile so i will be adding a .gitignore file to all the projects to manage the access github have.
## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
I am planning to add the sensitive information and credentials on a .gitignore file so that it is not easily accessible
